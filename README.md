# Emmet's Mustache

### A combination of [Emmet](http://emmet.io) and [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/). See the [demo](http://adam-lynch.github.io/emmetsMustache/).

So far, this is just a proof of concept. The idea would be to first compile/pre-process typical HTML/Mustache templates into abbreviated Emmet syntax and then send as little of possible of the wire between server and client. 

The server-side compilation of the templates would be the hardest part. **Feel free to contribute**.
